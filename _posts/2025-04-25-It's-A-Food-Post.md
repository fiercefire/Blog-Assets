This table will definately get more refined as I make more food posts. 

I do not normally go into work on Thurdays but I did go in this week for a short day to finish something. I ended heading out at about 1:00 PM and decided that since I was already nearit would be a good oppurtunity to walk over and check out Now Serving, a cookbook store. I ended deciding to get food at Philippe The Original (would recommend). I should not have been suprised therewas a massive line inside, so I choose to head on over to the Little Jewel of New Orleans which was nearby. Honestly, I would not have done so if my friend had not previously mentioned it to me. The Chinatown area is not the best, so the outside is not amazing looking but the inside was nice. There were all kinds of random little decorations put up.

They had these colored and laminated menus to look at the cashier and I totally forgot to take a picture of it so we will just have to make do with some random pics of them I ripped off google maps. They are a tad bit out of date, but they are close enough.

One of the thing the restaurant is known for are po' boys so I went for that. I enjoy catfish so I opted to try their Louisiana Fried Catfish Filet Po' Boy over the typical shrimp po' boy. Scarfed it down with a nice cup of ice water. Normally, my appetite would make me order more food than just a single po' boy but since it is seafood it was on the pricer side. I also did not get any desert since I wasn't feeling it, but definately would have gotten some beignets. It was one of those restaurants where you ordered and paid before sitting down, and the wait was not too long (5-10 mins?) before they called me over to the counter to grab my food. The po' boy was nicely sized and the bread was nice and soft. The veggies and pickles in the sandwich did a great job of cutting through and balancing out the heaviness of the fried catfish. I even put a dash of the cajun seasoning and hot sauce which were present at all the tables. The hot sauce was real delicous, it was more sweet and tangy than hot honestlt, but I enjoyed nevertheless. Overall I was satisifed with my meal.

Unfortunately, the grocery portion of Little Jewel of New Orleans seems to defunct.

I think I might come back again in the future to try some other items on the menu like the other po' boys, beignets, and some of those hot platters sound very good. I also want to try their Famous Craw Mac I saw a sign for and heard some people ordering.

After I continued on to Now Serving which was only about a 5 minute walk away. It is located in this 2 story shopping arcade which had a couple restaurants that were all quite busy, espically the Howlin' Rays that was there. It was nice and cozy inside the store and much smaller than expected. I had a good look around but did not buy anything; I snagged a free bookmark however. They did had a super nifty little sliding bookshelf ladder setup. I for sure want floor to celing bookshelves with a sliding bookshlef ladder in my house in the future. They also had a sign asking for no pictures so I am just going to yoink a photo off the internet for this post.
